- ✅ **Complete Data Parsing:** Successfully parsed complex nested JSON structure containing Customer and Business service categories
- ✅ **Dynamic Service Display:** Built comprehensive service discovery showing ALL available services from API
- ✅ **Advanced Fee Calculation:** Robust calculation engine supporting multiple fee types:
  - Fixed fees (`"$1"`, `"$0.50"`, `"₦200"`)
  - Percentage fees (`"1.5%"`, `"3%"`)
  - Capped percentage fees (`"1.5% ($1 – $5)"`, `"2% ($1–$2)"`)
  - Free services (`"FREE"`)

### 2. Exchange Rate Endpoint Integration  
**Endpoint:** `https://2kbbumlxz3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/exchange?from=USD&to=NGN`

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ **Real-time Rate Display:** Live USD to NGN conversion rates (1 USD = 1480 NGN)
- ✅ **Currency Conversion:** Automatic conversion of amounts and fees between currencies
- ✅ **Live Integration:** Seamless integration with fee calculations for accurate pricing
