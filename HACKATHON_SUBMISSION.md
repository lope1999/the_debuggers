## API Endpoints Integration

### 1. Fee Endpoint Integration

**Endpoint:** `https://2kbbumlxz3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/fee`

#### Our Interpretation & Implementation:

- **Data Structure**: We parsed the complex nested JSON structure containing Customer and Business service categories
- **Dynamic Service Display**: Created a comprehensive service categories component that displays all available services from both Customer and Business accounts
- **Real-time Fee Calculation**: Implemented dynamic fee calculation supporting multiple fee types:
  - Fixed fees (e.g., "$1", "$0.50", "â‚¦200")
  - Percentage fees (e.g., "1.5%", "3%")
  - Capped percentage fees (e.g., "1.5% ($1 â€“ $5)", "2% ($1â€“$2)")
  - Free services ("FREE")

#### Key Features Implemented:

- **Service Categories Display**:
  - Customer services: Freedom Virtual Card, US/NG Virtual Bank Accounts, Payout, Wallet Transfer, FX
  - Business services: Collections, Business Payout, Virtual Bank Accounts, FX, Wallet Transfer
- **Interactive Calculator**: Users can select account type, service category, and specific service
- **Multi-currency Support**: USD and NGN calculations with proper formatting

### 2. Exchange Rate Endpoint Integration

**Endpoint:** `https://2kbbumlxz3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/exchange?from=USD&to=NGN`

#### Our Interpretation & Implementation:

- **Real-time Rate Display**: Shows current USD to NGN conversion rate (1 USD = 1480 NGN)
- **Currency Conversion**: Automatic conversion of amounts and fees between USD and NGN
- **Live Rate Integration**: Fetched exchange rates and integrated them into fee calculations

## Technical Architecture

### Component-Based Structure:

1. **API Service Layer** (`services/api.js`): Handles all endpoint communications
2. **Calculation Engine** (`utils/feeCalculations.js`): Processes complex fee structures
3. **Modular Components**: Header, Hero, ServiceCategories, Calculator, LoadingError, Footer
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with retry functionality

### Key Technical Achievements:

- **Robust Fee Parser**: Handles complex fee strings with regex parsing
- **Real-time Calculations**: Updates fees instantly as users change inputs
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes
- **Advanced Theme System**: Professional Light/Dark mode with smooth transitions and interactive backgrounds
- **Loading States**: Professional loading indicators and error handling
